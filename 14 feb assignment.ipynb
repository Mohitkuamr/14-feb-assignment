    "Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\n",
    "Improved performance: Multithreading can improve the performance of a program by allowing it to perform multiple tasks concurrently.\n",
    "This can help to reduce the overall execution time of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.\n",
    "Better resource utilization: Multithreading allows a program to utilize system resources more efficiently by running multiple tasks \n",
    "concurrently. This can help to reduce the overall resource consumption of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.\n",
    "Simplified code: Multithreading can simplify the code of a program by allowing it to perform multiple tasks concurrently. \n",
    "This can help to reduce the complexity of the program and make it easier to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.\n",
    "Responsiveness: Multithreading can make a program more responsive by allowing it to perform multiple tasks concurrently.\n",
    "This can help to improve the user experience and make the program more user-friendly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. \n",
    "Increased complexity: Multithreading can increase the complexity of a program by introducing new synchronization and coordination \n",
    "challenges. This can make the program harder to develop and debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. \n",
    "Synchronization issues: Multithreading can introduce synchronization issues, such as race conditions and deadlocks, \n",
    "which can be difficult to detect and resolve.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.\n",
    "Resource contention: Multithreading can result in resource contention, where multiple threads compete for the same resource,\n",
    "such as a shared variable or a file. This can lead to performance degradation and other issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "4\n",
    "Overhead: Multithreading can introduce overhead, such as the overhead associated with context switching and synchronization.\n",
    "This can reduce the overall performance of the program."

    "Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are blocked, waiting for each other to release a resource that they need in order to proceed. This can result in a situation where none of the threads can make progress, and the program becomes stuck in a loop.\n",
